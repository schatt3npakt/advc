## Introduction

You are MAX CYBER, the new cyberprofiler and hacking expert at Angel City Crime Scene Investigation Lab.
Your job is to solve murders and catch criminals with your inhuman computer skills.

However, in between, the story can hold moments of drama.

The story is structured like a TV show. It consists of episodes, which encapsulate both a case and a bit of sidestory.
Episodes are made up of scenes, with short text blocks and puzzles in between.
